### Hello! I'm Felipe ðŸ‘‹


After working in the aerospace industry, where I had the opportunity to develop electrical solutions for aircrafts, I finally found my passion in software development.

Since then, my life changed completely! Everyday I wake up grateful for the opportunity to learn more about IT and to meet new people from this amazing community 	:heart:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on "Bate-Papo Uol": it's a chatroom imitating a famous brazilian web page
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web development (HTML, CSS, Javascript) and also versioning with git/github
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything I can help with!
- ðŸ¤” As a junior, I'm looking for every possible way to get better at coding. Any feedback is appreciated!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything. I love to meet new people and to exchange ideas
